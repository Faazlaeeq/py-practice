    "### Practice Question: **Space Exploration Management System**\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with creating a system to manage a space exploration project using object-oriented programming. The system should involve managing rockets, astronauts, and missions. This problem will require the use of classes, objects, inheritance, constructors, and function variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Requirements:**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Base Class:**\n",
    "   - Create a class `Spacecraft` to represent a generic spacecraft.\n",
    "   - **Attributes:**\n",
    "     - `name` (name of the spacecraft).\n",
    "     - `fuel_capacity` (maximum fuel capacity in liters).\n",
    "     - `current_fuel` (initially set to 0).  \n",
    "   - **Constructor (`__init__`)** to initialize spacecraft attributes.\n",
    "   - **Functions:**\n",
    "     - `refuel(amount)` - Adds the specified amount to `current_fuel` if it does not exceed `fuel_capacity`.\n",
    "     - `launch()` - Prints a message indicating the spacecraft is launching if fuel is sufficient (e.g., 80% of capacity); otherwise, raises an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Derived Classes:**\n",
    "   - **Class: `Rocket`**\n",
    "     - Inherits from `Spacecraft`.\n",
    "     - Adds an attribute `payload_capacity` (in tons).\n",
    "     - Adds a function `add_payload(weight)` that checks if the weight can be added without exceeding `payload_capacity`.\n",
    "   - **Class: `Shuttle`**\n",
    "     - Inherits from `Spacecraft`.\n",
    "     - Adds an attribute `passenger_capacity` (number of astronauts it can carry).\n",
    "     - Adds a function `board_passengers(number)` that ensures the total passengers donâ€™t exceed the limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Astronaut Class:**\n",
    "   - Create a class `Astronaut` to represent individuals participating in missions.\n",
    "   - **Attributes:**\n",
    "     - `name` (name of the astronaut).\n",
    "     - `rank` (e.g., Commander, Scientist, Engineer).\n",
    "     - `experience_years` (years of experience).  \n",
    "   - **Constructor** to initialize the attributes.\n",
    "   - **Functions:**\n",
    "     - `assign_to_mission(mission)` - Assigns the astronaut to a specified mission.\n",
    "     - `display_details()` - Prints astronaut details including the mission name they are assigned to.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Mission Class:**\n",
    "   - Create a class `Mission` to represent a space mission.\n",
    "   - **Attributes:**\n",
    "     - `mission_name` (name of the mission).\n",
    "     - `spacecraft` (object of `Spacecraft`, `Rocket`, or `Shuttle`).\n",
    "     - `crew` (list of `Astronaut` objects assigned to the mission, initially empty).  \n",
    "   - **Constructor** to initialize the mission attributes.\n",
    "   - **Functions:**\n",
    "     - `add_crew(astronaut)` - Adds an astronaut to the crew if there is space available in the spacecraft (for `Shuttle`) or if the weight is within payload limits (for `Rocket`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Test the System:**\n",
    "   - Create multiple `Rocket` and `Shuttle` objects with varying capacities.\n",
    "   - Create several `Astronaut` objects with different ranks and experience levels.\n",
    "   - Create a `Mission` object and assign a spacecraft and crew to it.\n",
    "   - Test scenarios including:\n",
    "     - Refueling and launching the spacecraft.\n",
    "     - Adding astronauts beyond capacity (should trigger a limit check).\n",
    "     - Adding payload beyond capacity (should fail with a message).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Expected Output Example:**\n",
    "1. **Spacecraft Actions:**\n",
    "   - Rocket *Falcon 9* refueled with 1000 liters.\n",
    "   - Shuttle *Discovery* has boarded 5 passengers.\n",
    "   - Rocket *Falcon 9* launched successfully.\n",
    "   - Shuttle *Discovery* failed to launch due to insufficient fuel.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Astronaut Details:**\n",
    "   - Astronaut *John Doe* (Commander, 10 years experience) assigned to mission *Lunar Exploration*.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mission Details:**\n",
    "   - Mission *Lunar Exploration*: Rocket *Falcon 9* with 2 astronauts and 3 tons of payload onboard.\n",
